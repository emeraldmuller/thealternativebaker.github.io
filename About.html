                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="about_info">
                    My name is Emerald. I am currently the only person running this site, but I hope to have the help
                    of others in the future. I have dedicated my time learning how to create recipes that fit a variety of diets.
                    My inspiration for this initially came from the fact that I have both food allergies and a gluten intolerance and I
                    did not want to have to cut out my favorite foods from my diet. Along the way, I learned that others were in the same
                    position and that adapting recipes for other alternative diets wasn't much different than what I was doing for
                    my own diet.
                </p>
                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                <p class="about_info">
                    I do not view unconventional diets as inconveniences, rather, I see them as an opportunity to learn
                    a new way of baking. I know what it is like to be judged for having a certain diet, so I do not want to judge
                    others for having a diet that is different from my own. I like to challenge myself to learn to create recipes that
                    fit these diets but are also enjoyable. I also hope to help people realize that no matter the diet, there can still be
                    good quality food.
